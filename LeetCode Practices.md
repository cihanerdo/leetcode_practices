**[175. Combine Two Tables](https://leetcode.com/problems/combine-two-tables/)**

---

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.

```

Table: `Address`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.

```

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the `Person` table. If the address of a `personId` is not present in the `Address` table, report `null` instead.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output:
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation:
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.
```

**SOLUTION**

```sql
select p.firstName,
p.lastName,
a.city,
a.state 
from address a
right join person p on p.personID=a.personID
```

Write a solution to **delete** all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify `Person` in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the `Person` table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the `Person` table. The final order of the `Person` table **does not matter**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
```

**SOLUTION**

```

Write a solution to report the **fraction** of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, **rounded to 2 decimal places**. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |

| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Explanation:
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
```

**SOLUTION**

```sql
SELECT ROUND(playerCount / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) from Activity), 2) as fraction 
FROM 
(
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Activity.player_id) playerCount 
  FROM Activity, 
  (
    SELECT player_id, min(event_date) as startEventDate
    FROM Activity 
    GROUP BY player_id
  ) firstLogin 
  WHERE datediff(event_date, startEventDate) = 1 and Activity.player_id = firstLogin.player_id
) temp;

| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
Theposition column has a value from1 to500.
Therating column has a value from1 to5. Query withrating less than 3 is a poor query.

```

We define query `quality` as:

> The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
> 

We also define `poor query percentage` as:

> The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
> 

Write an SQL query to find each `query_name`, the `quality` and `poor_query_percentage`.

Both `quality` and `poor_query_percentage` should be **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:

| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
Explanation:
Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33
```

**SOLUTION**

```sql
select distinct query_name,
round(avg(rating/position),2) as quality,
round(sum(case when rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) * 100 / count(*),2) as poor_query_percentage
from queries

+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Explanation:
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96
```

**SOLUTION**

```sql
SELECT P.product_id,
ROUND(SUM(PRICE*UNITS)/SUM(UNITS),2) AS average_price
FROM PRICES P
INNER JOIN UNITSSOLD U ON U.PRODUCT_ID=P.PRODUCT_ID AND purchase_date between start_date and end_date

| Handbags      | -23000            |
+---------------+-------------------+
Explanation:
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.
```

**SOLUTION**

```sql
select distinct (stock_name),
sum(
  case
  when operation='buy' then -price
  when operation='sell' then price
  end) as capital_gain_loss
  from stocks
group by stock_name

+-------------+----------------+
Explanation:
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.
```

**SOLUTION**

```sql
select v.customer_id as customer_id,
count(v.visit_id) as count_no_trans
from visits v
left join transactions t on t.visit_id=v.visit_id
where t.transaction_id is null
group by v.customer_id

+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null).

```

For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all **managers**, the number of employees who report **directly** to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

Explanation:
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.
```

**SOLUTION**

```sql
select employee_id , 
   case when employee_id%2 <>0 and name not like 'M%' then salary 
   else 0
   end 
   as bonus
   from employees
   order by employee_id;
```

**[1890. The Latest Login in 2020](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-latest-login-in-2020/)**

---

Table: `Logins`

```
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the login time for the user with ID user_id.

```

Write a solution to report the **latest** login for all users in the year `2020`. Do **not** include the users who did not login in `2020`.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Logins table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 6       | 2020-06-30 15:06:07 |
| 6       | 2021-04-21 14:06:06 |
| 6       | 2019-03-07 00:18:15 |
| 8       | 2020-02-01 05:10:53 |
| 8       | 2020-12-30 00:46:50 |
| 2       | 2020-01-16 02:49:50 |
| 2       | 2019-08-25 07:59:08 |
| 14      | 2019-07-14 09:00:00 |
| 14      | 2021-01-06 11:59:59 |
+---------+---------------------+
Output:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | last_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 6       | 2020-06-30 15:06:07 |
| 8       | 2020-12-30 00:46:50 |
| 2       | 2020-01-16 02:49:50 |
+---------+---------------------+
Explanation:
User 6 logged into their account 3 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 8 logged into their account 2 times in 2020, once in February and once in December. We include only the latest one (December) in the result table.
User 2 logged into their account 2 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 14 did not login in 2020, so we do not include them in the result table.
```

**SOLUTION**

```sql
select user_id, max(time_stamp) as last_stamp 
from Logins
where year(time_stamp)=2020
group by user_id
```
